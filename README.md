# Loan Default Prediction
In the financial sector, accurately predicting loan defaults is crucial for loan providers to make informed decisions and minimize risks. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict potential loan defaults, based on customer demographics of loan applicants, with over 90% accuracy. In this project, we trained four different models utilizing Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest architectures. The performance of each model was evaluated on the holdout set using the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix and ROC AUC. In addition, we analyzed features correlation as well as feature importance and discussed the advantages and limitations of each model.
